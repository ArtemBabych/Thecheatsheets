                        <p> In this section, you can learn or refresh your
                            knowledge

                        <br>
                        <p> HTML - the simple
                            language
                            that provides you an opportunity to create a
                            website.
                            First of all, it was designed to create a structure
                            and
                            fill in the site with content like text, images,
                            video,
                            and audio, and connect them with hyperlinks to
                            create a
                            huge system of many pages of your own website. Or
                            just
                            chain it with the web as a whole.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p>At its core, HTML revolves around the concept of
                            elements. Each HTML element represents a distinct
                            part of your content and is surrounded by tags,
                            denoted by angle brackets. These tags define the
                            structure and semantics of your document, enabling
                            browsers to interpret and display the content
                            appropriately. </p>
                        <br>

                        <p>Here are some key HTML elements that form the
                            backbone of web development:</p>

                        <p>HTML's
                            strength

                                An HTML element is a fundamental building block

                                Language) uses a system of tags to encapsulate
                                and organize different types of content within a
                                document. Each HTML element is comprised of a
                                start tag, content, and an end tag, with the
                                content representing the actual information to
                                be displayed.</p>

                                used to define and
                                structure content on a web page. HTML tags are
                                enclosed in angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) and
                                come in
                                pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The
                                opening tag denotes the beginning of an element,
                                and the closing tag signifies the end of that

                                refers to the practice of adding spaces or tabs
                                at the beginning of lines of code to visually
                                organize and structure the code. While
                                indentation is not strictly necessary for the
                                browser to interpret and render HTML, it is
                                essential for making the code more readable and
                                maintainable, especially as web development
                                projects become more complex.

                                the web page. Comments can be useful for
                                documenting your code, providing context for
                                other developers, or temporarily disabling parts
                                of the code for testing purposes.

                                HTML comments are written using the &lt;!-- and

                                There are two main types of file paths: absolute
                                and relative.

                                include the entire file path, starting from the

                                helps create a clear document structure. Search
                                engines and assistive technologies use heading

                                of content on a page. It's good practice to use
                                headings semantically, with &lt;h1&gt; for the
